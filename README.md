The performance improved a lot after refactoring the code. Previously, the times for each sample were about 1000-1400 ms. After optimization, the sample times went down to 10-20 ms (about a 98%-99% decrease in sample time).

The times for each sample were about 90-130 ms. After optimization, the times went down to 5-20 ms. This is a huge performance improvement; about a 85%-95% decrease in the sample time.
